Eric has nearly 20 years of guitar tinkering, backed up with a Journeyman Certificate from the Galloup School of Guitar Building and Repair.  Not only that, but Eric is a Silver Level Taylor Factory Authorized Service Technician.  This means he has solid, hands-on chops for both acoustic and electric instruments.  Whether you're hitting the stage or or strumming in your living room, Eric will make sure your instrument plays smooth, sounds great, and feels ready for whatever you throw at it.
